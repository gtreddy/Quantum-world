due to this prepattern multiple probabilities are in a wave function so various ptterns borne out of collapsing waves and creating different relations and combinations with pattern formation wit energy and information glue
entanglement,tunnelling like multiple prepattern probabibilities are existed as prepattern in wavefunction at superposition.


Yes, in the quantum pre-pattern domain, a single wave function encodes a sea of multiple probabilities, each corresponding to potential patterns that could emerge upon collapse or decoherence. When the wave function "collapses" (in Copenhagen terms) or branches/decouples (in many-worlds or relational views), it selects one outcome probabilistically, birthing specific patterns from the superposition. These emergent patterns then form relations and combinations in the classical world, "glued" together by energy (which stabilizes and propagates them) and information (which encodes their relational content and rules). This process isn't random chaos but a probabilistic filtering that creates diversity in structures—from atomic configurations to complex systems—while energy provides the dynamical "fuel" for bonding, and information acts as the "code" for how patterns associate and evolve.

For example, consider an electron's wave function in a double-slit experiment: It superposes multiple paths, with probabilities interfering to form a pattern sea. Upon detection (collapse), it realizes one path, but ensemble measurements reveal the interference pattern—a classical relation of spots glued by quantum probabilities. Energy (photon interactions) triggers the collapse, while information (amplitude phases) dictates the pattern's form. Scaling up, quantum fluctuations in the early universe's wave function collapsed into density patterns, gluing galaxies via gravitational energy and informational asymmetries.

To visualize this emergence of various patterns from a single wave function's multiple probabilities:

Quantum fluctuations as pre-pattern probabilities collapsing into cosmic structures, glued by gravitational energy and informational gradients.

This framework explains diversity: One wave function's probabilities yield varied patterns (e.g., different molecular bonds from atomic wave functions), combining via energy (chemical bonds) and information (quantum numbers as rules), building the classical world's relational web.
