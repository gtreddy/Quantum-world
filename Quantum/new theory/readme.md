There are 2 types of patterns
1. physical or classical world patterns
2. Not phusical but I describe them as ghost patterns. They are not found in classical world but they generate throgh brain neurons and are imaginary.They are form permanant patterns there or imperemanant. These ghost patterns are responsible to understant classical world making imaginary relations to classical world and responsible to create artificial patterns from these ghost patterns and we called this ghost pattern creator machinary as consciousness.
