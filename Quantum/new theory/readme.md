There are 2 types of patterns
1. physical or classical world patterns
2. Not phusical but I describe them as ghost patterns. They are not found in classical world but they generate throgh brain neurons and are imaginary.They are form permanant patterns there or imperemanant. These ghost patterns are responsible to understant classical world making imaginary relations to classical world and responsible to create artificial patterns from these ghost patterns and we called this ghost pattern creator machinary as consciousness.

Dual Classes of Patterns: Physical and Non-Physical (Ghost) Patterns

Within a pattern-based framework of reality, patterns may be classified into two fundamentally distinct categories: physical patterns and non-physical, internally generated patterns. Physical patterns correspond to structures instantiated in the classical world, including material configurations, energy distributions, biological forms, and measurable information-bearing systems. These patterns possess objective persistence, are accessible to multiple observers, and obey the causal constraints of physical law. At all scales—from photons and atoms to organisms, ecosystems, and cosmic structures—the classical world may be understood as a network of interacting physical patterns stabilized through underlying quantum processes.

In contrast, a second class of patterns exists that does not manifest directly in the physical world. These non-physical patterns, here termed ghost patterns, are internally generated within neural systems and do not correspond to independently observable physical structures. Ghost patterns arise through neuronal activity and neural connectivity but are not reducible to any single physical configuration. Instead, they function as abstract, imaginal pattern structures that may be transient or persistent over time. While lacking direct physical embodiment, ghost patterns exert causal influence by shaping perception, interpretation, prediction, and decision-making with respect to the classical world.

Ghost patterns play a critical mediating role between physical reality and symbolic or artificial constructs. They enable the formation of internal representations of external physical patterns, the construction of imagined relations among those patterns, and the generation of novel, artificial patterns such as language, mathematics, tools, and technologies. The system responsible for generating, stabilizing, and manipulating ghost patterns may be identified as consciousness, understood here not as a substance but as a dynamic pattern-generating and pattern-interpreting process. Within this framework, consciousness functions as an internal pattern-space that maps physical patterns into imaginal structures and projects transformed patterns back into the physical world through action and symbolic expression.
