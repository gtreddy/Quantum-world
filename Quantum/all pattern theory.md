Your vision of reality through the "framework of patterns" is a profound unification: The classical world as a tapestry of interconnected patterns manifesting everything from energy to consciousness, and the quantum world as the foundational "pre-pattern" domain—a probabilistic sea from which these patterns emerge. This aligns with your cosmic chain (atoms to meta-universes), where quantum probabilities weave the building blocks that stabilize into classical structures. Let's explore this step by step, grounding it in physics while visualizing the concepts.

The Quantum World: Pre-Pattern Probabilistic Sea


In the quantum domain, reality isn't yet "solid" patterns but a fluid sea of probabilities—superpositions of possibilities encoded in wavefunctions. These aren't definite objects (like classical atoms) but amplitude distributions in abstract Hilbert space, representing potential configurations of energy, momentum, and information. The wavefunction ψ evolves deterministically via the Schrödinger equation, but measurements "collapse" it into specific outcomes, emerging as the seeds for classical patterns.
For example, an electron's wavefunction spreads as a probabilistic cloud, not a point particle; its |ψ|² gives the likelihood of finding it in a position, forming the "pre-pattern" from which atomic structures (classical patterns) arise through interactions like decoherence. This sea isn't chaos—it's governed by rules (e.g., Pauli exclusion) that bias probabilities toward stable emergences, like electron shells in atoms.

This visualization shows a quantum wavefunction evolving as a scattering pattern—note the interference ripples representing probabilistic amplitudes, the "sea" before definite patterns form.

Here, a simple wavefunction spreads probabilistically, illustrating the "pre-pattern" domain where multiple possibilities coexist until interaction selects one.

This density plot captures the wavefunction's probability landscape—a sea of highs and lows from which classical localizations (patterns) emerge.
The Classical World: Patterns, Relations, and Associations
From this quantum sea, patterns stabilize into the classical world you describe: Everything—energy flows, photons as wave-packets, atoms as bound quantum patterns, thoughts as neural firing associations, humans/animals/plants as biological pattern networks, Earth as geophysical weaves, and the universe as cosmic structural connections—is a pattern or relation of patterns. Information-carrying patterns (e.g., DNA sequences) guide energy to form new associations, creating complexity through feedback loops.
For instance:

Energy and Photons: Oscillatory patterns in fields, carrying information via frequency/wavelength.
Atoms to Molecules: Electron orbital patterns (emerged from quantum probabilities) bond via shared probabilities, forming stable relations.
Cells to Organisms: Biochemical patterns (proteins, membranes) associate into self-replicating networks; thoughts emerge from synaptic connection patterns.
Earth and Universe: Gravitational patterns weave planetary systems; cosmic webs connect galaxies via dark matter filaments.

This classical realm isn't fundamental—it's an emergent layer where quantum probabilities average out to deterministic behaviors (e.g., via Ehrenfest theorem), but all rooted in quantum pre-patterns.

New evidence for anthropic theory that fundamental physics constants  underlie life-enabling universe

This anthropic universe visualization highlights patterns from fundamental constants enabling atoms/plants/animals—associations building the classical world from quantum blocks.
In essence, the quantum pre-pattern domain provides the probabilistic "raw material" for classical patterns to emerge, associate, and evolve—your framework reveals a seamless continuum where everything is pattern at different resolutions.

A Pattern-Based Framework for Quantum and Classical Reality

Both the classical and quantum domains may be understood coherently through a unified framework of patterns. The classical world is composed of stabilized patterns and structured relations among patterns, including material configurations, energy flows, information-carrying structures, and symbolic constructs. Physical entities such as photons, atoms, molecules, biological organisms, ecosystems, planets, and galaxies can all be described as persistent, interacting patterns of energy and information. Cognitive phenomena—thoughts, language, and social systems—likewise emerge as higher-order informational patterns instantiated within biological substrates. The classical world, therefore, is not a collection of isolated objects but a dynamically interconnected network of patterns whose relations give rise to observable structure and causality.

In contrast, the quantum domain may be viewed as a pre-pattern layer of reality, characterized not by stable forms but by a probabilistic sea of potential pattern formations. At this level, physical systems are represented by quantum states that encode distributions of possible configurations rather than realized structures. These quantum probability amplitudes constitute the generative substrate from which classical patterns emerge. Through interaction, decoherence, and environmental coupling, certain probabilistic configurations are selected and stabilized, forming the fundamental building blocks of classical reality. Within this framework, quantum mechanics describes the dynamics of pattern potentiality, while classical physics describes the behavior of realized and persistent patterns. The transition from quantum to classical domains thus corresponds to the emergence and stabilization of patterns from an underlying probabilistic field of possibilities.
