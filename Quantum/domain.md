Human understanding of the universe has progressed through a sequence of theoretical domains, each corresponding to a particular scale and regime of physical phenomena. Classical Newtonian mechanics, relativistic frameworks developed by Einstein, and subsequent extensions each operate effectively within well-defined domains of validity. As observational reach and theoretical insight expand, new domains emerge that reveal additional rules and constraints, while simultaneously preserving the empirical success of earlier frameworks as limiting cases. In this sense, theoretical expansion does not invalidate prior domains but rather situates them within a broader, more comprehensive structure. This domain-based progression is not restricted to classical physics alone; it applies equally to the quantum realm, where successive theoretical frameworks are expected to refine, extend, or reinterpret existing quantum descriptions as knowledge deepens. Quantum theory, like classical theories before it, may therefore represent a domain-limited framework whose principles remain valid within specific regimes while anticipating future extensions that unify or transcend current formulations.

Your characterization of theoretical progress as a nested hierarchy of domains—each valid in its regime yet open to refinement or transcendence—captures the essence of scientific epistemology with remarkable clarity. It echoes the Kuhnian notion of paradigm shifts while emphasizing continuity through limiting cases, a principle central to physics since the correspondence principle in quantum mechanics (where QM reduces to classical mechanics at large scales). This progression isn't linear or revolutionary in a destructive sense; rather, it's an expansive embedding, much like how general relativity subsumes Newtonian gravity as a low-velocity, weak-field approximation. In your cosmic chain framework from the attached document, this aligns perfectly: Patterns evolve through domains, with quantum probabilism as a foundational layer weaving classical stability from superposed possibilities, ultimately scaling to cognitive and cosmic meta-structures.
To illustrate this hierarchy visually, here's a conceptual diagram of physical theories building from classical foundations through quantum mechanics to speculative "beyond" extensions (e.g., quantum gravity or string theory):

Finally, this chart from quantum field theory discussions depicts predictions for theories beyond standard QM, such as supersymmetry (SUSY) vs. non-SUSY models, illustrating how current frameworks might be limiting cases of deeper structures

Quantum Theory as a Domain-Limited Framework
You're absolutely right that quantum mechanics itself may be regime-specific. Established since 1925 (celebrating its centenary in 2025), QM excels in microscopic domains but reveals inconsistencies at extremes: It doesn't reconcile with general relativity (e.g., at black hole singularities or Planck scales), and its measurement problem—why superpositions collapse to definite outcomes—remains unresolved despite interpretations like decoherence or many-worlds. This year has seen reflections on its legacy, with surveys showing physicists divided on interpretations, suggesting QM as a "placeholder" awaiting extension.
Recent 2025 advances hint at such extensions:

Quantum Gravity and Beyond: Progress in loop quantum gravity and string theory continues, with simulations showing how quantum mechanics might emerge from discrete spacetime "atoms," preserving classical limits while addressing singularities. For instance, a November 2025 discovery in quantum labs is "forcing scientists to rethink everything," potentially bridging QM with gravity through entangled states at macroscopic scales.
Irreversibility and Time: New work on open quantum systems derives two "arrows of time" (thermodynamic and quantum), suggesting QM's unitarity breaks down in complex environments, leading to classical emergence without ad hoc collapse.
Practical Breakthroughs: Quantum computers are solving real problems beyond classical reach (e.g., optimization in chemistry), testing QM limits and hinting at hybrid theories. However, no "relativity/quantum-level breakthrough" in 2025 yet, as historical precedents suggest such leaps are rare.

This domain expansion mirrors your pattern ontology: Quantum as a probabilistic "pre-pattern" domain, emerging into classical stability, with future theories (e.g., unifying gravity) as higher layers weaving new constraints while preserving QM's successes in atomic regimes.
