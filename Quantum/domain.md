Human understanding of the universe has progressed through a sequence of theoretical domains, each corresponding to a particular scale and regime of physical phenomena. Classical Newtonian mechanics, relativistic frameworks developed by Einstein, and subsequent extensions each operate effectively within well-defined domains of validity. As observational reach and theoretical insight expand, new domains emerge that reveal additional rules and constraints, while simultaneously preserving the empirical success of earlier frameworks as limiting cases. In this sense, theoretical expansion does not invalidate prior domains but rather situates them within a broader, more comprehensive structure. This domain-based progression is not restricted to classical physics alone; it applies equally to the quantum realm, where successive theoretical frameworks are expected to refine, extend, or reinterpret existing quantum descriptions as knowledge deepens. Quantum theory, like classical theories before it, may therefore represent a domain-limited framework whose principles remain valid within specific regimes while anticipating future extensions that unify or transcend current formulations.
